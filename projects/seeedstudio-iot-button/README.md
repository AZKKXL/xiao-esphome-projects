# Seeed Studio IoT Button

This project provides configurations and code for the Seeed Studio IoT Button, a versatile smart device based on the ESP32-C6. It supports both the first generation (V1) and second generation (V2) of the device, with options for ESPHome (WiFi) and Arduino with Zigbee programming.

**Note**: This repository contains ESPHome YAML configurations (`seeedstudio-iot-button.yaml` for IoT Button V1, `seeedstudio-iot-button-v2.yaml` for IoT Button V2), **MQTT configuration (`seeedstudio-iotbutton_MQTT.yaml` for IoT Button V1)**, and Arduino code for both IoT Button V1 and IoT Button V2. Select the appropriate files based on your device version and programming preference.
