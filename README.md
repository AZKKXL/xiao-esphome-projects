## Projects

### Project 1: XIAO 2 Channel Wi-Fi AC Energy Meter

XIAO 2 Channel Wi-Fi AC Energy Meter is a dual-channel electricity meter based on bl0939, which can measure electrical parameters such as current, voltage, and power. SeeedStudio-2CH-EM adopts the current transformer solution of bl0939, which can provide higher electrical measurement accuracy.

### Project 2: XIAO Soil Moisture Monitor

XIAO Soil Moisture Monitor is used to monitor soil moisture and feedback the current status through a three-color LED. It supports manual calibration and automatic deep sleep to save energy. It is suitable for scenes such as flower pots and planting boxes.

### Project 3: Seeed Studio IoT Button

The Seeed Studio IoT Button is a multifunctional Internet of Things (IoT) device that can be seamlessly integrated with smart home systems. It supports both ESPHome and Zigbee connectivity options, enhancing its versatility and usability.
